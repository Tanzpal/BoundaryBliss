            the <span>cricket</span> Now is the winter of our discontent Made
            glorious summer by this sun of York; And all the clouds that lour'd
            upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. Now are our
            brows bound with victorious wreaths; Our bruised arms hung up for
            monuments;

            the <span>football</span> brings together nations in a celebration
            of speed, skill, and passion. With every kick, the crowd roars,
            uniting under one goal. Football is more than a sportâ€”it's a global
            language.
